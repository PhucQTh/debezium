## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

<p align="center"> Change Data Capture (CDC) is a powerful technique that allows you to capture all the changes made to your database in a single place. It is a fundamental concept in event sourcing and CQRS architectures. CDC applications are used to build real-time data pipelines, audit trails and to replicate data across multiple systems.
